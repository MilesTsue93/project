### Description:

The project uses:

* Flask framework
* CSS
* HTML
* SQLite3
* Bootstrap
* DB Browser for SQLite

 *This is a hub for a user where they can personalize their own page full of interesting content based on their search queries*

There are HTML pages for:
1. a user's content home page
2. an about page to explain the purpose of the web application
3. an error page rendering a customized error message if something goes awry
4. a login page
5. a register user page
6. a page showing index of past generated content
7. a general layout template from which all the other templates inherit their properties

 *A portion of this code was refactored from Problem Set 9: Finance from CS50's class, including the layout HTML page, the login route and the logout route, the hashed_password functions from Werkzeug's libraries, and some bootstrap dependencies. I also adamantly refrained from availing the CS50 codespace and it was taxing figuring out how to configure database and API keys locally, but I did it, by golly.*

Youtube Data API was used through my google developer account. URL to youtube data api: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/

#### This is my final project for Harvard's CS50: Intro to Computer Science, taught by David Malan.
