### Description:

#### This is my final project for Harvard's CS50: Intro to Computer Science, taught by David Malan.

The project uses:

* Flask framework
* CSS
* HTML
* SQLite3
* Bootstrap

#### This is a hub for a user where they can personalize their own page full of interesting content based on their search queries

There are HTML pages for:
1. a user's content home page
2. an about page to explain the purpose of the web application
3. an error page rendering a customized error message if something goes awry
4. a login page
5. a register user page
6. a page showing index of gpast enerated content

As well as a general layout template where all the pages inherit their properties

#### *A portion of this code was refactored from Problem Set 9: Finance from CS50's class, including the layout HTML page, the login route and the logout route, and the hashed password*
